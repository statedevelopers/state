XMP extension for PHP
---------------------

By Alexander Block

These are the sources of an XMP (Extensible Metadata Platform by Adobe) extension
for PHP based on the exempi library which is therefore based on the Adobe XMP
Toolkit (http://www.adobe.com/devnet/xmp/).

REQUIREMENTS
------------

- Sources of the exempi library, see http://libopenraw.freedesktop.org/wiki/Exempi
- Sources of the expat XML parser (required by exempi), see http://expat.sourceforge.net
- PHP 5.2.x (other PHP versions may work but they have not been tested yet), see http://www.php.net


INSTALLATION
------------

To compile the XMP PHP extension follow the described steps.

1. Unpack and install PHP 5.2.x to get the files "phpize" and "php-config"

2. Unpack and install the expat XML parser to get the shared library "libexpat.so"

3. Unpack and install exempi using the "configure" command (use the "--prefix"
   parameter to change the target base directory) followed by "make" and "make install"

4. Unpack the XMP PHP extension file and change into the directory "php_ext"

5. Run "<PHPDIR>/bin/phpize"
   Exchange "<PHPDIR>" with the name of the directory where PHP has been installed

6. Run "./configure --prefix=<PREFIX> --with-exempi=<EXEMPIDIR>
                    --with-php-config=<PHPDIR>/bin/php-config --with-expat --enable-xmp"
   Exchange "<PREFIX>" with the name of the target directory where XMP PHP should be installed
   Exchange "<EXEMPIDIR>" with the name of the directory where the exempi files have been
            installed (see the "--prefix" parameter in 3.)
   Exchange "<PHPDIR>" with the name of the directory where PHP has been installed

7. Run "make" to compile the extension

8. Run "make install" to copy the file xmp.so to the extension directory of your PHP
   installation. If the file is for any reason copied to the wrong directory, have a
   look on the value of the "extension_dir" setting in your php.ini file or use the
   "phpinfo()" function in a PHP script to get this setting and copy the file manually
   to the directory that is assigned as a value to this setting.

9. Activate the extension by adding the following line to your php.ini file

   extension=xmp.so

   Some distributions also use separate ini files for each extension e.g. in a directory
   "/etc/php/ext-active". In this case it is also possible to create a file xmp.ini in
   this directory and add the metioned line to this file.

10. Execute "php -i" on the command line or "phpinfo();" in a PHP script and search for
    an output telling you "XMP enabled". When using a webserver remember to restart the
    webserver first.
